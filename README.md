## [Exercise Tracker](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/exercise-tracker)

This was the project I made for the [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org).


### What this project do?
  This API can track your activity you entered in the exercise block and return a json object of the activities you entered.
  You can also return the activities/exercise you perform in a time period(range).
